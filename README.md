This repository contains my work from the Quantium Data Analytics Job Simulation hosted on Forage, completed in December 2025.

The simulation replicates real-world tasks performed by Quantium’s Data Analytics & Commercial Insights team, focusing on transforming transaction data into actionable business insights to support strategic decision-making.

## Objective
The primary objective of this simulation was to:
1. Analyze large-scale retail transaction data
2. Understand customer purchasing behavior
3. Support commercial decision-making using data-driven insights
4. Communicate findings clearly to business stakeholders

## Key Skills & Concepts Applied

1. Data preparation & cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Customer analytics & segmentation
4. Benchmark store selection
5. Uplift testing logic for trial store layouts
6. Business insight generation
7. Data-driven storytelling for non-technical stakeholders

## Project Tasks Breakdown
---Task 1: Data Preparation & Customer Analytics---

1. Cleaned and explored transaction-level retail data
2. Analyzed customer purchasing behavior and product performance
3. Identified key drivers of sales and customer engagement
